Simulink-MIDI-Controller
========================

Procedure for Setting up a MIDI Controller with Simulink

###Mathworks Description

Mathworks provides a [brief overview](http://www.mathworks.com/help/dsp/examples/using-a-midi-control-surface-to-interact-with-a-simulink-model.html) of what the procedure entails. To actually use the blocks provided, one must open up the 'dspmidi' example in MATLAB, by typing 'dspmidi' into the command prompt. This will open up the picture shown on the website.

###Procedure

To actually use the blocks, the 'dspmidi' must be open in order for the blocks to be drag-and-dropped into the desired projejct. The Mathworks example provides five general examples, that can be tweaked. Use the block that fits most closely to your need. For my project, I needed an adjustable gain. Mathworks provides an attenuation example, this was close enough for what I needed.
